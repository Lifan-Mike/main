# NYU Metropolitan Mobile Bandwidth Trace 

## Summary
NYU Metropolitan Mobile Bandwidth Trace, a.k.a. NYU-METS, is a LTE mobile bandwidth dataset that were measured in New York City metropolitian area.

## Description 

We collected long bandwidth traces in New York City Metropolitan area. These traces are collected in Bus, Subway, Ferry and Rail Road etc. 

Bus: Bus B57, B62 and NYU Campus Bus Route A;

Subway: Subway 7 Train, Subway Q Train and Subway D Train;

Ferry: Ferry between South Ferry and Staten Island;   
Long Island Rail Road: Long Island Rail Road between Woodside Station and Little Neck. 

For each experiment, we connect a LTE mobile phone to a remote server in our lab at NYU. 
We run iPerf and record TCP throughput every 1,000 millisecond for a long and successive time in the same scenario. All the bandwidth samples are logged on the server side. 

We are continuing this measurement campaign and keep adding new traces to our NYU-METS Dataset for future research.
