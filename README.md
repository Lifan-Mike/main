# NYU Metropolitan Mobile Bandwidth Trace 
NYU Metropolitan Mobile Bandwidth Trace, a.k.a. NYU-METS, is a LTE mobile bandwidth dataset that were measured in New York City metropolitian area.

We collected long bandwidth traces in New York City MTA bus and subway by ourselves.
It includes Subway 7 Train, Subway Q Train, Bus B57 and B62. 

For each experiment, we connect a LTE mobile phone to a remote server in our lab at NYU. 
We run iPerf and record TCP throughput every 1,000 millisecond. All the bandwidth samples are logged on the server side. We are continuing this measurement campaign and keep adding new traces to our NYU-METS Dataset for future research.


The site is still in construction.
