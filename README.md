# NYU Metropolitan Mobile Bandwidth Trace 
NYU Metropolitan Mobile Bandwidth Trace, a.k.a. NYU-METS, is a LTE mobile bandwidth dataset that were measured in New York City metropolitian area.


Our dataset is FREE for public. But we kindly ask that should you mention any of our datasets, or use our code, in your publication, that you would reference the following paper: 

*Lifan Mei, Runchen Hu, Houwei Cao, Yong Liu, Zifa Han, Feng Li & Jin Li. (2019, March). Realtime Mobile Bandwidth Prediction using LSTM Neural Networks. In International Conference on Passive and Active Network Measurement. Springer, Cham.*


We collected long bandwidth traces in New York City Metropolitan area Bus, Subway, Ferry, Long Island Rail Road.
It includes Bus B57, B62 and NYU Campus Bus Route A; Subway 7 Train, Subway Q Train Subway D Train; Ferry between South Ferry and Staten Island; Long Island Rail Road between Woodside and Little Neck; 

For each experiment, we connect a LTE mobile phone to a remote server in our lab at NYU. 
We run iPerf and record TCP throughput every 1,000 millisecond. All the bandwidth samples are logged on the server side. We are continuing this measurement campaign and keep adding new traces to our NYU-METS Dataset for future research.


The site is still in construction.
